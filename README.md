# Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces

Deep learning applications have seen substantial advancements with the advent of the Transformer
architecture and its attention mechanism. Despite its success, Transformers face challenges in
handling long sequences due to their inherent computational inefficiency. Several subquadratic-time
architectures have been proposed to address this limitation, but they have not
matched attention-based models’ performance on crucial tasks such as language processing. In this
report, we identify the inability of these models to perform content-based reasoning as a key weakness and
focus on Mamba, a novel neural network architecture that integrates selective structured state space
models (SSMs) to address this limitation.
